# TFLOW-EDGE

This repository contains a collection of scripts and examples
to get students started in an exploratory 2-week course using EEG
signals from the low-cost 8-channel EEG device "Traumschreiber" and
tensorflow neural network classifiers on the Intel(r) Movidius Neural
Compute Stick.


*Note th: All code related to recording EEG requires a working [Traumschreiber](https://www.traumschreiber.uni-osnabrueck.de/) with up to date firmware*
